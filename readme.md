# SK108 Controller

This was supposed to be a control center for SK108 and related boards but then my PCB got destroyed after I made the 'ripple' mode speed fast and then reset my board (FN+ESC). It is up to the community to improve upon this.

Their official control center doesn't work properly and it crashed a lot. It doesn't detect your devices because it uses hardcoded product IDs strings, which may change from board to board.

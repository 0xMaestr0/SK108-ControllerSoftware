# SK108 Controller

This was supposed to be a control center for SK108 and related boards. I wanted to contribute to the open-source community for once in years, but as I was writing this I decided to experiment around. I deobfuscated the original drivers and quickly made a working examlpe. I then thought, what would've happened if I made the 'ripple' mode speed as fast as possible? It turned out that it looked cool if you were a night club enthusiast, and it also built up my seizure tolerance! I decided to turn backlight off and then my keyboard stopped sending input to the computer, and I didn't panic as it happened before while writing the driver and experimenting with random settings, so I simply reset it by holding FN+ESC for 5 seconds.. and so I ran my controller again, except that the lights were static while they were supposed to have the ripple effect so I turned the backlight off again and then my keyboard stopped working. It didn't even show up in the USB devices list nor light up once I connected it to my device.

Their official control center doesn't work properly and it crashes a lot. If it doesn't detect your device, it is because their center software uses hardcoded product IDs which may change from board to board, which is why it fails to detect your board.
